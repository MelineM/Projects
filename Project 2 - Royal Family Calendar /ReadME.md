# Project 2 - Royal Family Calendar

In this project I scraped the British royal family's website, www.royal.uk, and constructed a csv file with all the relevant information for the events scheduled for particular members of the royal family withing a given time frame.

In this project you will find examples of:

* Functions
* For loops
* Web scraping
* Beautiful Soup
* Regex
* GeoText library
* Data cleaning
* DataFrames
