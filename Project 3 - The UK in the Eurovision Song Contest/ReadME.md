# Project 3 - The UK in the Eurovision Song Contest


In this project I  investigate the reasons why the UK scores so poorly in the Eurovision song Contest. 
In order to try to improve our ranking we have sent stars like Andrew Lloyd Webber, Bonnie Tyler, Engelbert Humperdink and the boyband Blue. 
However, this did not help the UK's chances.

So where are we going wrong?

I investigate:

* The Big 5 rule
* Brexit's effect
* Whether it is the jury or the viewers who dislike the UK

The data used in this project is from kaggle.com and covers the voting results, by and to country, from 1975 to 2019.

In this project you will see examples of:

* Data Cleaning
* DataFrame manipulation
* Pivot tables
* Data visualisation (matplotlib)
