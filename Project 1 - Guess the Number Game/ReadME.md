# Project 1 - Guess the Number Game

In this first project I exercise my knowledge in Python to create the classic "Guess the Number" game, making it as interactive and fun as possible.

In this project you will find demonstrations of:

* Functions
* If/elif/else statements
* While loops
* Flags
* Time & datetime modules
