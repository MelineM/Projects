# Project 4 - Predicting Solar Radiation Levels

Solar radiation is energy emitted by the sun from a nuclear fusion reaction. It can be captured and converted into energy. It is important to us because it is a clean and renewable energy source. The ability to predict the levels in a particular location is an essential part of the decision making process when building solar energy farms.

Solar radiation levels depend on:

* Geographic location
* Time of day
* Season
* Local landscape
* Local weather

With this is mind, which supervised learning model is the best for predicting solar radiation levels?

The data used in this project was collected at the HI-SEAS weather station across 4 months (Sept - Dec 2016).

In this project you will find:

* Data cleaning
* Correlation
* Data Visualisation
* Supervised learning
  * Linear Regression
  * Decision Tree
  * Random Forest
  * K Nearest Neighbour
  * Ensemble
